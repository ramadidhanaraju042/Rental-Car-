🚗 Car Rental System (Java Console Project)

🌟 Overview:

Welcome to the Car Rental System — a Java-based console application that simulates a real-world car rental experience.
This project helps beginners and intermediate learners understand core Java concepts like OOP, arrays, loops, and conditional logic — all while managing cars, customers, and rentals through a clean and interactive menu system.

💬 “Drive your Java learning journey with real-world logic!” 🚘

⚙️ Features:

| 🚗 Feature                 | 🧩 Description                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🚀 **Rent a Car**          | Seamlessly rent cars using an interactive console menu. |
| 🔁 **Return a Car**        | Effortlessly return cars and update their availability. |
| 👥 **Customer Management** | Add and manage customer records with names and IDs.     |
| 🚘 **Car Management**      | Maintain car brands, models, and pricing details.       |
| 📝 **Rental History**      | Track all rentals, customers, and rental durations.     |

🧠 How It Works:

🖥️ The program starts with a menu-based interface.

👤 User can register, rent, or return a car.

📊 System updates availability and rental history dynamically.

🔁 Runs continuously until the user chooses to exit.

🧮 All logic is handled in-memory using arrays and objects.

💡 Perfect for understanding OOP logic flow in real-world scenarios.
